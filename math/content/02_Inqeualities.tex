\subsection{Inequalities}

	\subsubsection{Properties of Inequalities}
	\[ a > b , c > 0 \implies ac > bc \]
	\[ a > b , c < 0 \implies ac < bc \]
	\[ \frac{a}{b} > 0 \implies ab > 0 \]
	\[ \frac{a}{b} < 0 \implies ab < 0 \]
	Positive sides of inequalities suggest that both terms share similar positive or negative signs, negative sides of inequalities suggest that both terms have opposite positive or negative signs
	\subsubsection{Quardratic Inequalities}
	Find where \(f(x)=0\) by completing square or quadratic formula and sketch graph
	\subsubsection{Inequality Reduction}
	For any inequality \(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} > or < 0\) where \(f(x)\) or \(g(x)\) is strictly positive or negative, reduce inequality to non-strictly positive/negative function and change sign accordingly
	\subsubsection{Modulus Inequalities}
	\[ |x| < a \iff -a < x < a \]
	\[ |x| > a \iff x  < -a \quad or \quad a < x \]
	\[ |x-a| < b \iff a-b < x < a+b \]
	\[ |x-a| > b \iff x < a-b \quad or \quad a+b < x \]
	To solve inequalities, sketch and find intercept, then deduce suitable range of \(x\)
