\section{Stoichiometry}
	
	\subsection{Particles and Relative Mass}

	\scidef{Proton Number / Atomic Number}{The Proton Number is the number of protons in an atom of that element. This determines the identity of the atom.}
	\scidef{Nucleon Number / Mass Number}{The Nucleon Number is the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom.}
	\scidef{Nuclide}{A Nuclide is a species of atom with a specific proton number and nucleon number, written \(^\text{Atomic Number}_\text{Nucleon Number}\text{X}\)}
	\scidef{Isotope}{Isotopes of an element are atoms with the same proton number but different nucleon numbers}
	\scidef{Relative Isotopic Mass}{Relative Isotopic Mass is the mass of an atom of a specific isotope divided by \(\frac{1}{12}\) the mass of a carbon-12 atom, and is unitless}
	\scidef{Relative Atomic Mass}{Relative Atomic Mass is the weighted average of the masses of naturally occurring species of a specific element, and is unitless. The value is calculated as 
	\[ 
		\text{A}_\text{r} = \frac{\sum \text{Nucleon number} \times \text{Fractional abundance}}{\frac{1}{12}\text{the mass of a carbon-12 atom}}
	\]}
	\scidef{Relative Molecular / Formula Mass}{Relative Molecular Mass is the relative mass of one covalent molecule of a certain substance, obtained as the sum of the \usub{A}{r}s of its constituent atoms. Relative Formula Mass is similar but used for ionic compounds and is calculated using the smallest collection of atoms from which a formula can be made (AKA a formula unit).}

	\subsection{The Mole}

	\scidef{Mole}{A mole of substance is the amount of a substance which contains as many elementary elements (molecules, ions, electrons, atoms, particles etc) as there are  atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12. Alternatively, it is the amount of substance which contains \(6.0 \times 10^{23}\) carbon-12 atoms, also known as the Avogadro constant and written as \(L\).}

	\scidef{Molar Mass}{Molar mass is the mass of a mole of substance with units grams per mole.}

	\subsection{Chemical Formulae}

	\scidef{Empirical Formula}{The Empirical Formula of a compound is the simplest ratio of number of atoms of different elements in one molecule.}
	\scidef{Molecular Formula}{The Molecular Formula of a compound is the actual number of atoms of each element in one molecule of the compound.}

	A molecular formula of a substance is always a multiple of its empirical formula. Since Ionic compounds do not exist in single molecules, they do not have a molecular formula.

	\subsection{Stoichiometry}

	\scidef{Stoichiometry}{Stoichiometry is defined as the study of the proportions of which molecules react with each other.}
	\scidef{Stoichiometric Amounts}{Stoichiometric Amounts of a substance are the amounts which undergo reaction.}

	From a balanced equation, one can obtain:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Ratios of moles of reactants and products
		\item Masses of reactants and products
		\item Volumes of gases evolved
	\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Limiting Reagent}

	When reacting substances, reactants may exceed stoichiometric amounts and not be reacted.

	\scidef{Limiting Reagent}{The Limiting Reagent in a reaction is the reactant which is deficient and consumed completely in a reaction.}

	\subsubsection{Yield}

	\scidef{Theoretical Yield}{The Theoretical Yield of a reaction is the mass of product formed calculated using the chemical equation and the amount of limiting reagent used.}
	\scidef{Actual Yield}{The Actual Yield of a reaction is the mass of product that is actually obtained after reaction.}
	\scidef{Percentage Yield}{The Percentage Yield is the ratio of actual yield to theoretical yield presented in percent.}

	\subsubsection{Volume of Gases}

	Avogadro's hypothesis states that at conditions of constant temperature and pressure, the same volume of gas contains the same number of molecules and vice versa.

	\scidef{Molar Volume}{The Molar Volume \usub{V}{m} is the volume taken up by 1 mole of gas at a certain temperature and pressure. Common temperatures and pressures include: \\
		Standard Temperature and Pressure (s.t.p.) at 273K and 100000 Pa or 1 bar gives \usub{V}{m} = 22.7 \udmcpmol. \\
		Room Temperature and Pressure (r.t.p.) at 93K and 101325 Pa or 1 atm gives \usub{V}{m} = 24 \udmcpmol.
	}

	\subsection{Concentration}

	\scidef{Solution}{A Solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances, with the more abundant substance being the solvent and the less abundant substance the solute.}
	\scidef{Concentration}{The Concentration of a substance is the amount or mass of substance dissolved per unit of solvent or solution. The molar concentration is written by enclosing the name of substance in square brackets and has units \umolpdmc. The mass concentration has units \ugpdmc}
	\scidef{Standard Solution}{A Standard Solution is a solution of known constitution and concentration.}

	\subsection{Acid-Base Titration}
