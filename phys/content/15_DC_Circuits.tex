	\scidef{Potentiometer}{A Potentiometer is a circuit component whose resistance can be varied.}

	\scidef{Galvanometer}{A Galvanometer is a sensor used to determine small flows in current and is used to identify balance lengths where there is no current passing through it, i.e. used to find two points whose potential difference is 0.}

	\scidef{Balance Length}{The Balance Length is the position on a resistance wire where the current passing through a galvanometer attached to that point and another point on an external circuit is zero.}
