\subsection{Principle of Superposition}

\scidef{Principle of Superposition}{The Principle of Superposition states that the effect of two stimuli at a point is the sum of the two responses.}

\subsection{Stationary Waves}

\subsubsection{Stationary Waves in String}

\subsubsection{Stationary Waves in Pipes}

\subsection{Interference}

\subsubsection{Double Source Interference}

\subsubsection{Diffraction Grating}

\scidef{Diffraction Grating}{A Diffraction Grating is a sheet of material with multiple apertures on its surface. In optics, typical diffraction gratings have around 1000 apertures per cm.}

Light passed through a Diffraction Grating creates interference patterns 

\subsubsection{Single Source Diffraction}

\scidef{Diffraction}{Diffraction (or more specifically Fraunhofer diffraction in the H2 syllabus) is the phenomena where a wave radiates in a radial fashion when passed through an aperture of comparable length to its wavelength.}
