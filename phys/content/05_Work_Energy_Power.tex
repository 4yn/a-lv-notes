\scidef{Energy}{Energy is the amount of }

\scidef{Work}{Work is the amount of energy expended upon a certain object, defined as the product of the amount of force applied and the distance travelled in the direction of the force, measured in \si{J} or \si{kg m^2 s^{-2}}}

\scidef{Power}{Power is the quantification of work done with respect to time, defined as the rate which work is done with respect to time or the amount of energy transferred with respect to time, measured in \si{W} or \si{kg m^2 s^{-3}}}
