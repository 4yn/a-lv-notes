\section{Gravitation}

\scidef{Gravitation}{Gravitation is defined as the attractive force between to masses.}

\scidef{Newton's Law of Gravitation}{Newton's Law of Gravitation states that every point mass attracts every single other point mass along a line intersecting both points, which is proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two masses.}

\scieqn{Gravitational Force}{ F = G \frac{m_1m_2}{r^2} }

\scieqn{Gravitational Acceleration}{ g = G \frac{m_1}{r} }

\scieqn{Gravitational Potential Energy}{ U = - G \frac{m_1m_2}{r} }

\scieqn{Gravitational Potential}{ \phi = - G \frac{m_1}{r} }
