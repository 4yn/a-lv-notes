\section{Gravitation}

\scidef{Gravitation}{Gravitation is defined as the attractive force between to masses.}

\scidef{Newton's Law of Gravitation}{Newton's Law of Gravitation states that every point mass attracts every single other point mass along a line intersecting both points, which is proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two masses.}

\scieqn[gathered]{Gravitational Equations}{For the mass of two planetary objects \(m_1\) and \(m_2\), the radius between them \(r\), and the gravitational constant \(G\), the force experienced by each of the planets \(F\), the acceleration of a planet \(g\), the potential energy of a each planet \(U\) and the potential gradient of a planet \(\phi\) are given by the equations}{
	F = G \frac{m_1m_2}{r^2} \\
	g = G \frac{m_1}{r} \\
	U = - G \frac{m_1m_2}{r} \\
	\phi = - G \frac{m_1}{r} \\
