\subsection{Censorship and Free Speech}

\begin{description}
	\item[Censorship] is defined as the suppression of speech, public communication or other forms of media which may be considered harmful, insensitive, politically incorrect or inconvenient as deemed by parties such as governing bodies and media outlets. Key examples of modern-day censorship include the Great Firewall of China, China's censorship of the Tianmen Square massacre, US omission of the KKK in history textbooks, Japan's omission of WWII crimes and Singapore's Internal Security Act as well as the local system of OB markers

\begin{description}
	\item[Analysis] Need to make the distinction between privilege which suggests that it is provided and can be relinquished and entitlement which suggests that free speech is a right. Reduce the question to ``should we be able to remove peoples rights to free speech''
	\item[For Points] :
		\begin{description}
			\item[Abuse] of free speech is a real possibility where undue libel and attacks of people can have external repercussions. For example, the recent rise of social media vigilantism as well as doxxing as a very real phenomena. Countries like Singapore and the UK all have laws against hate speech, especially in the realm of religion.
			\item[Harmful Potential] of free speech, especially in multicultural societies where strong beliefs and opinions are more than likely to clash and result in harm, as such having the power to remove freedom of speech enables people to be protected, right to comfort and safety of opinion and thoughts with regard to culture is preserved. Examples include the 2015 Charlie Hebdo shootings and other similar incidences.
		\end{description}
	\item[Against Points] :
		\begin{description}
			\item[Protection of Rights] in that free speech is a guarantor of other rights and freedoms, where having the power to remove freedom of speech compounds into issues of preventing checks and balances on government, as well as checks and balances on the presence of other rights. Having the ability to restrict rights may also open doors to other rights being infringed upon, considering cases such as the tight control the Chinese government has over the whole country.
			\item[Practicality] in that there is no truly objective judgment of what is offensive and inappropriate, at that point the governing bodies are given too much power.

\paragraph{`The media needs to exercise more responsibility.' DYA? (RJC/15)}-

\begin{description}
	\item[Analysis] Do note the qualifier `More' as well as have a clear understanding of what the media does, as well as society's expectations of the media, namely accuracy, objectivity (to its most possible extent), timeliness, quality and ethical practice and the implications of proper practice and malpractice (misinformed public, societal insecurity etc).
