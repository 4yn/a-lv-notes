	\item[Analysis] Though the question asks for ``Should'', it is not a matter of which is the ideal situation as arguing for and against ideals results in a largely evidence-lacking essay. Aim to provide a moderate and realistic opinion on marriage and its changing nature as seen today. Think of scenarios where it is no longer applicable for marriage to be expected to last for life, and especially since there is a direct anti-thesis to marriage (divorce), also consider the scenario where that is permissible.

	\item[Against Points] :
		\begin{description}
			\item[Conscious Uncoupling] is a new phenomena brought about by the fact that marriages are now lasting longer since people are generally living longer, which leads to the scenario where people change and grow incompatible over time.
			\item[Availability] of divorce makes ending a marriage ever more easy. As of 2010, the USA provides no-fault divorce across the country, following similar countries like Sweden, Spain and Australia.
			\item[Externalities] in that marriages can and will turn sour, through abuse or general disagreement. In this respect, ending a marriage is advantageous to the parents as well as to children who are victims of a dysfunctional parenthood.
			\item[Independence] in that reasons for women staying in abusive or unfavorable marriages are no longer as prevalent, such as the rise of financially independent women as well as the recent development of womens domestic rights.
			\item[Cultural Shift] towards a more libertarian opinion of marriage, as seen by the development of social policy and also the rise of alternate family structures.
